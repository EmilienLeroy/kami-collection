      ## Install 
      
      ```console
      $ npm install --save @kamiapp/pdf
      ```
      
      ## Usage
      
      Import the component using [native ESM via script tags](https://caniuse.com/es6-module) and use it directly into your html file :
      
      ```html
      <body>
        <kami-pdf src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/pdf.js/ba2edeae/examples/learning/helloworld.pdf"></kami-pdf>
      
        &lt;script type="module"&gt;
          import '@kamiapp/pdf';
        &lt;/script&gt;
      </body>
      ```

      > The `src` is needed to load the pdf. Else it will throw an error.

      With the `scale` attribute, you have complete control over the size of your pages. 
      You can easily adjust the scale to zoom in and out of specific sections of the document or to fit the entire page on your screen. 

      ```html
      <kami-pdf src="https://your-file.pdf" scale="2"></kami-pdf>
      ```

      With the `loading` slot feature, you can customize the user experience while your pdf is loading. 
      This is particularly useful for websites or applications with large PDF files that may take some time to load.

      ```html
      <kami-pdf src="https://your-file.pdf" scale="2">
        <div slot="loading">
          <h2 style="color: var(--kami-theme-text)">Loading ...</h2>
        </div>
      </kami-pdf>
      ```
